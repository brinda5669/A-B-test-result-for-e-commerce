# A-B-test-result-for-e-commerce
This project will help to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The main goal is to work through this notebook to help the e-commerce company understand if they should implement the new page, 
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
